The change will now fire at the exact time — whether or not anyone is logged in. The scheduler also captures a daily metrics snapshot (headcount, salary totals, vacancies, gender split, level distribution) which will power trend reports in a future release.

Fields are grouped into Person, Employment, Location, Contact, Role, and Hierarchy sections. Auto-hint matching and value mapping (↔ Map values) work for all enum fields.

      detail: 'The root cause of the Org Chart crash after AI creates roles or departments: the org chart uses numeric IDs throughout (nextRoleId, Math.max over all role IDs, etc.). When the AI created entities with UUID string IDs, Math.max(...ids) returned NaN, breaking ID generation and rendering in subtle ways. AI-created entities now use nextNumericId() — the same sequential logic the org chart uses — so they integrate seamlessly.

      body:   'Applying multiple AI-suggested changes in quick succession no longer overwrites earlier ones, and department name/ID mismatches no longer crash the org chart.',
      detail: 'Two bugs fixed in the AI action card flow. First, clicking Apply on several cards quickly could cause a race where each card fetched the same pre-change state and the last write won, losing earlier changes. Applies are now serialised — each waits for the previous to finish. Second, the AI sometimes passed a department name (e.g. "Sales") where a department ID was expected; the org chart then failed to find the department and threw inside init(), showing "Cannot connect to server". Apply logic now resolves names to IDs automatically as a fallback. Also fixed a missing id field on role assignments created via create_person.',

      detail: 'The AI assistant previously could only suggest field-level edits (e.g. change a salary or job title). It can now propose structural changes: creating a new department or role, moving a role to a different department or manager, and deleting empty departments, roles, or people. As before, every proposal appears as a confirm card — nothing changes until you click Apply.

      detail: 'The database was returning an empty response when all data was cleared, which the client treated as "fresh install — seed with 120 employees". Fixed by writing an _initialized flag on the first save so the server can distinguish a cleared org from a brand-new one. Also fixed a debounce race where navigating away within 300ms could prevent the save from firing.',

      detail: 'The AI assistant page no longer shows a person selector. Your identity is taken directly from your authenticated session, so previewing as any person via Switch User automatically gives the AI the right context. The "Apply change" button on AI suggestions is now gated on edit rights from the Permissions page (edit_org_chart, edit_directory, edit_salaries) rather than a hard-coded role list.

      body:   'Previewing as a person now correctly shows the data that person is entitled to see — salaries, pay bands, and org chart editing all reflect their actual permission groups.',
      detail: 'When switching to view as a person via the Switch User modal, data was being filtered using the JWT base role (always "employee") rather than the person\'s actual effective rights from their permission groups. This caused the dashboard to show only one person, pay bands to appear empty, and the org chart to show a connection error.

      detail: 'The Switch User modal no longer shows a role dropdown. Every person in the org chart can now be previewed simply by clicking "Log in as" — their effective rights come from the assignment policies and permission groups configured on the Permissions page, exactly as they would in production. The impersonation banner now shows the person\'s real name instead of a synthesised email address.',

      body:   'Super-admins can now log in as any person in the org directly from the Switch User modal — no user account required.',
      detail: 'The Switch User modal now lists every person in the organisation. People with an existing user account show their role and use the normal login-as flow. People without an account show a role selector (Employee / Manager / HR Admin / Org Admin) — selecting a role and clicking Log in as creates a temporary impersonation session scoped to that person and role, with no credentials stored.
